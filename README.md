Provisioning an Amazon EKS Cluster Using Terraform:

This guide walks through the steps for provisioning an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Terraform. Terraform provides a declarative way to manage cloud infrastructure and allows you to easily provision, configure, and manage EKS resources.

Prerequisites:

Authentication & Authorization: Use OIDC + IAM for secure GitHub Actions access to AWS, with custom policies and admin full access for Terraform deployments.

GitHub Branches: Main, Dev, and Stage branches to manage the infrastructure across different environments.

Terraform State Management: Use S3 (remote storage) with separate statefiles for different environments using Terraform Workspaces.

Parameterization: Avoid hardcoding values in the Terraform EKS code, and use tfvars files to parameterize different environments.

GitHub Secrets: Store sensitive information securely using GitHub Secrets.
